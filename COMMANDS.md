I had to issue the following refining command:

```
These workflows generate the following error -- please fix them:  This request has been automatically failed
because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.
```

The workflows errored out, so I submitted the defect back to Claude-Flow

```
The demo.py script errored out, but the workflow completed successfully. Please fix.  Error messages received:
Error getting storage account details: Unexpected error: 'str' object has no attribute 'value'
Error getting network rules: Unexpected error: 'StorageAccountsOperations' object has no attribute 'get_network_rule_set'
Error getting storage metrics: Unexpected error: 'str' object has no attribute 'value'

```

The windows test workflow errored out with the following trace:

Both operating system test workflow produce the following error. Can you fix?
```
[DEMO] Running detailed demos for: aspevttestderek
Error:  Error getting storage account details: Unexpected error: 'str' object has no attribute 'value'
```

I've three problems with demo.py. First, an identical error is occurring in both operating systems. Second, the error isn't causing the workflow to fail. Third, the error isn't emitting a stack trace so I can see which section of code has the problem.  Can we fix?  Error reported is:
```
